            <h2>What Makes a Great Injera?</h2>
            <p>
                A great injera starts with high-quality teff flour, blended with water and left to ferment naturally for a few days. The fermentation process gives injera its signature tangy flavor and bubbly texture. Cooking it requires skill to pour the batter evenly onto a hot griddle, creating a thin, even layer that cooks perfectly.
